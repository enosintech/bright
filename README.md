# bright

Bright is a Cross Platform mobile application I developed as part of my studies. Built in React Native, Bright is a social wellness application where one can track and manage their stress levels and emotions,
as well as connect with other people feeling similar feelings. The application was developed with Firebase for the backend and TailwindCSS through Native Wind for UI design and implmentation.
